description: '"In all times and ages, the deeds of the men who sail the deep as its
  policemen or it soldiery have been sung in praise. It is time for chronicle of the
  high courage, the reckless daring, and oftentimes the noble self-sacrifice of those
  who use the Seven Seas to extend the markets of the world, to bring nations nearer
  together, to advance science, and to cement the world into one great interdependent
  whole"--Introd.'
